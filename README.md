Hello everyone!
I am Bishnupada Sahu currently studying B.Tech in Iter Soa Bhubaneswar. 
This is my web development project i.e. a portfolio website under Oasis Infobyte.
I thank Oasis Infobyte for giving such a good opportunity to me.

We create a personal portfolio with the basic skills in CSS and HTML. This is yet again, one of the most common projects on web development. In a personal portfolio, we get to show a wide range of samples and skills and add the resume. We add an image at the top where the introduction is given and the contact details of that person.
